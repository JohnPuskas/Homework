## About Me
I am currently enrolled in Savvy Coders Full Stack Web Development course.
I have some prior experience with Python and C#/.NET, and have dabbled a bit with JavaScript.
I spend my free time writing and producing music.

### While enrolled in Savvy Coders Full Stack Web Development course, I hope to:
- Gain a solid understanding of HTML/CSS and responsive web design.
- Learn to use JavaScript as a back end language.
- Be positioned to move into a new direction as a web developer.
